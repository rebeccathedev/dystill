dystill is a sorting, filtering MySQL-based Mail Delivery Agent written in 
Python. See INSTALL for installation instructions, and LICENSE for the code 
license agreement.

RULES EXPLAINED

Once you have the software installed and working, the next step is to add some
rules to get it to do what you want. Right now, there is no graphical front-end
to the SQL database, but writing one or adding it to an existing mail package
should be trivially easy.

The filters Table:

The main table that dystill uses is the filters table. This table consists of a 
unique identifier (filter_id), an email field representing the email address of
the recipient, a field, a value, an integer that determines whether or not a 
filter is active or not, and a comparison field that describes the type of 
comparison taking place.

The comparison types are:
 0 = Starts With
 1 = Ends With
 2 = Contains
 3 = Is (an exact equals)
 4 = Regular Expression

The fields you really need to worry about are the field and value fields. These
represent a header, and a regular expression match against the value of the 
header.

For example:

insert into filters set email='user@domain.org', field='X-Spam-Flag', 
comparison=3, `value`='YES', active=1;

This will create a filter that matches on the spam flag. Using regular 
expressions, you can create complex filters or very simple ones. It's up to you.
If you filters with a user_id of 0, these are automatically applied to all 
messages. This is useful for spam filtering.

The actions Table:

The accompanying filters_actions table describes the actions that are taken when
a filter matches. This table consists of a unique ID (action_id), a filter_id 
linking back to the filters table, an action string, and an argument string.

The big two are the action and argument. Valid actions are:

 * markasread - Marks the message as read.
 * flag       - Flags a message.
 * deletes    - Deletes a message. The message is still delivered, but is marked
                for deletion.
 * prependsub - Prepends text to the subject string. The argument shoud be the
                string to prepend.
 * header     - Adds a header to the message. The argument should be a key:value
                pair.
 * forward    - Automatically queues a forward message to a specified address.
                The argument should be the address you want to forward it to. 
 * block      - Silently blocks delivery. This will tell the MTA that the 
                message was delivered, but will silently dispose of it.
 * blocknote  - Blocks delivery, but informs the sending address that delivery
                was blocked. Also called "ex-girlfriend logic."
 * copyto     - Duplicates the message, and puts a copy in a different folder.
                The argument should be the folder you want to move it to.
 * to         - Moves the message to the specified folder. The argument should
                be the address you want to move it to.
 
By the time it reaches the end of the action chain, if the message hasn't been
delivered, it is automatically added to the inbox as any normal email would be.
